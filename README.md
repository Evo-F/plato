# Plato
Plato is a **static-site generator** intended for turning a collection of Markdown files into a blog-style static site. 

Plato is heavily inspired by [Plerd](https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd), a similar project written in Perl. With the latest release of Plerd being in December of 2019, and the repository largely inactive, I took it upon myself to attempt replicating Plerd's core functionality in Python.

# Why "Plato"?
I named the project Plato for two reasons:
- The first is that, because I was so inspired by Plerd, I wanted a name that sounded a bit like it.
- The second is that Plato the *person* was largely responsible for writing down the words of Socrates, one of the greatest philosophers of ancient Greece. In doing this, he made the work of Socrates more accessible and allowed it to be expounded upon well after Socrates' death.
